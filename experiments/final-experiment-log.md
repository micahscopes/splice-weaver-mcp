# Final CLI Exploration Results

## What I Discovered

Through systematic CLI exploration, I found that the ast-grep CLI has **significantly more capabilities** than what's exposed by the current MCP server. The MCP server essentially only exposes the basic `run` command functionality.

## Key Missing Features Tested

### ✅ **Inline Rules** - Most Important Discovery
- **Test**: Successfully ran multiple rules in one command
- **Result**: Rich formatted output with different severity levels
- **Impact**: Eliminates file management complexity for LLMs

### ✅ **Debug Query** - Critical for Pattern Development  
- **Test**: Used `--debug-query` to understand pattern failures
- **Result**: Showed exactly why `println!($$$)` pattern failed (the `!` creates an ERROR node)
- **Impact**: Would dramatically help LLMs debug pattern construction

### ✅ **Context Lines** - Essential for Code Understanding
- **Test**: Used `-C 2` to show surrounding code
- **Result**: Provided valuable context around matches
- **Impact**: Helps LLMs make better transformation decisions

### ✅ **Project Scaffolding** - Workflow Enhancement
- **Test**: Created complete project with `new project` and `new rule`
- **Result**: Generated proper templates with schema validation
- **Impact**: Guides LLMs toward best practices

### ✅ **Testing Framework** - Quality Assurance
- **Test**: Created and ran snapshot tests for rules
- **Result**: Precise match position tracking and regression testing
- **Impact**: Allows LLMs to validate their rule creation

## Key Insights for LLM Usability

1. **Pattern Debugging is Critical**: The `--debug-query` feature would solve the main LLM challenge with ast-grep pattern construction
2. **Batch Operations Matter**: Running multiple rules at once is much more efficient than individual calls
3. **Context is Essential**: Surrounding code helps LLMs make better decisions
4. **File Management is a Barrier**: Inline rules eliminate the complexity of managing rule files
5. **Rich Output Improves UX**: Formatted errors with line numbers and severity levels are much better than plain text

## Recommendations

The MCP server should be enhanced to expose these powerful CLI features, with priority on:
1. Inline rules capability
2. Pattern debugging support  
3. Context line options
4. Batch rule execution
5. Rich formatting controls

These enhancements would transform ast-grep from a pattern matching tool into a comprehensive code analysis platform perfectly suited for LLM interaction.

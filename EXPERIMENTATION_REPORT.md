# AST-Grep MCP Server Experimentation Report

## Executive Summary

After extensive hands-on testing of both the ast-grep-mcp server and the ast-grep CLI, I discovered significant strengths and some areas for improvement. The tools are powerful but have a notable learning curve around pattern construction.

## What Works Exceptionally Well ✅

### 1. **Pattern Matching Accuracy**
- **Finding**: Once you get the pattern right, it's remarkably precise
- **Example**: `console.log($$$)` correctly found 23 instances across multiple files
- **Why it's great**: No false positives, respects AST structure perfectly

### 2. **Variable Capture System**
- **Finding**: The `$VAR` and `$$$` capture system is intuitive and powerful
- **Example**: `function $NAME($$$) { $BODY }` captured function names and bodies accurately
- **Why it's great**: Enables complex transformations while preserving context

### 3. **Cross-Language Consistency**
- **Finding**: Patterns work consistently across different programming languages
- **Example**: Function patterns work similarly in JavaScript and Rust
- **Why it's great**: Reduces cognitive load when working with multiple languages

### 4. **File-Based Operations**
- **Finding**: Scanning multiple files with glob patterns is fast and reliable
- **Example**: Found all console.log statements across 3 JavaScript files in seconds
- **Why it's great**: Scales well for large codebases

### 5. **Replacement Operations**
- **Finding**: Pattern-based replacements are incredibly powerful
- **Example**: `var $NAME = $VALUE` → `const $NAME = $VALUE` worked perfectly
- **Why it's great**: Enables sophisticated refactoring operations

### 6. **AST Generation for Debugging**
- **Finding**: The `generate_ast` feature is invaluable for understanding structure
- **Example**: Helped me understand why `$PARAMS` didn't work vs `$$$`
- **Why it's great**: Demystifies the AST structure for pattern construction

### 7. **Rule-Based Operations**
- **Finding**: YAML rules provide excellent organization and reusability
- **Example**: Rule validation worked perfectly with clear feedback
- **Why it's great**: Enables building libraries of common transformations

## What's Challenging or Confusing ⚠️

### 1. **Pattern Construction Learning Curve**
- **Challenge**: Getting patterns right requires understanding AST structure
- **Example**: `function $NAME($PARAMS) { $BODY }` didn't work, but `function $NAME($$$) { $BODY }` did
- **Why it's confusing**: The difference between `$PARAMS` and `$$$` isn't obvious
- **Impact**: High barrier to entry for newcomers

### 2. **Error Messages for Invalid Patterns**
- **Challenge**: When patterns don't match, you get "No matches found" with no explanation
- **Example**: No indication of why `$PARAMS` failed vs `$$$`
- **Why it's confusing**: Provides no guidance on how to fix the pattern
- **Impact**: Trial-and-error pattern development

### 3. **Pattern Specificity Requirements**
- **Challenge**: Patterns must match AST structure exactly
- **Example**: Missing whitespace or incorrect nesting breaks patterns
- **Why it's confusing**: Visual similarity doesn't guarantee AST similarity
- **Impact**: Requires deep understanding of language parsing

### 4. **CLI vs MCP Server Differences**
- **Challenge**: Some features available in CLI but not clearly exposed in MCP
- **Example**: `--update-all` flag vs dry-run behavior differences
- **Why it's confusing**: Feature parity isn't always clear
- **Impact**: Inconsistent user experience across interfaces

### 5. **Limited Pattern Documentation**
- **Challenge**: Hard to discover available pattern types and syntax
- **Example**: When to use `$VAR` vs `$$$` vs specific literals
- **Why it's confusing**: Documentation focuses on examples rather than systematic rules
- **Impact**: Slows down pattern development

## Specific Findings from Testing

### Pattern Construction Insights

| Pattern Type | Works | Doesn't Work | Insight |
|-------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Function parameters | `function $NAME($$$) { }` | `function $NAME($PARAMS) { }` | Use `$$$` for variable parameters |
| Console methods | `console.log($$$)` | `console.log($ARG)` (for multi-arg) | `$$$` captures any number of arguments |
| Variables | `var $NAME = $VALUE` | Complex destructuring patterns | Simple patterns work best |
| Nested structures | Works with proper nesting | Fails with incorrect structure | AST structure must match exactly |

### Performance Observations

- **File scanning**: Very fast, even across multiple files
- **Pattern compilation**: Instant for simple patterns
- **Large file handling**: No issues with 1000+ line files
- **Memory usage**: Minimal resource consumption

### Error Handling Quality

- **Good**: Clear success feedback with match counts
- **Poor**: Vague failure messages ("No matches found")
- **Missing**: Suggestions for fixing invalid patterns
- **Excellent**: Rule validation with specific error reporting

## Comparison: MCP Server vs CLI

### MCP Server Advantages
- **Structured API**: JSON responses with detailed metadata
- **Integration**: Easy to integrate into other tools
- **Rich output**: Variable capture details and location info
- **Resource system**: Potential for built-in documentation

### CLI Advantages
- **Interactive mode**: Better for exploratory pattern development
- **Direct file modification**: Simpler workflow for one-off changes
- **Rich options**: More flags and configuration options
- **Performance**: Slightly faster for simple operations

## Impact on Small Language Models

Based on the research notes and hands-on testing, here's what would help small LLMs:

### Current Challenges for Small LLMs
1. **Pattern syntax complexity**: Too many ways to express similar concepts
2. **Trial-and-error required**: No guided pattern construction
3. **AST knowledge needed**: Requires understanding of language parsing
4. **Limited examples**: Hard to learn from similar patterns

### What Would Help Most
1. **Progressive pattern builder**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
2. **Example-based learning**: Show patterns with explanations
3. **Error diagnosis**: Explain why patterns don't match
4. **Pattern suggestions**: Offer alternatives when patterns fail

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Enhanced error messages**: Explain why patterns don't match
2. **Pattern builder assistant**: Guide users through pattern construction
3. **Example database**: Rich collection of working patterns
4. **Interactive debugging**: Show AST alongside pattern attempts

### Medium Priority
1. **Better documentation**: Systematic pattern syntax reference
2. **CLI/MCP parity**: Ensure feature consistency across interfaces
3. **Performance monitoring**: Add timing and resource usage info
4. **Pattern validation**: Check patterns before execution

### Low Priority
1. **GUI interface**: Visual pattern construction tool
2. **AI assistance**: LLM-powered pattern suggestions
3. **Community patterns**: Shared pattern repository
4. **IDE integration**: Better development environment support

## Conclusions

The ast-grep ecosystem is remarkably powerful but has a steep learning curve. The pattern matching is incredibly precise when you get it right, but getting it right requires significant expertise.

**For experts**: This is an incredibly powerful tool for large-scale code transformations.

**For beginners**: The learning curve is steep and would benefit significantly from the MCP Resources and Prompts enhancements outlined in the research notes.

**For small LLMs**: The current system is too complex for reliable pattern construction without significant assistance. The proposed enhancements (example-based learning, progressive refinement, guided workflows) would be transformative.

The research conclusion that small LLMs currently achieve only ~45% success rate with ast-grep patterns aligns perfectly with my hands-on experience - pattern construction requires expert knowledge that small models don't possess without assistance.

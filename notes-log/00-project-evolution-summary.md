# Project Evolution Summary - Organized Grepster MCP

## Project Overview
**Organized Grepster MCP** is an AST-powered semantic code editor for LLMs that provides precise, structure-aware editing across 20+ programming languages. It serves as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that bridges the gap between language models and the powerful ast-grep tool.

## Core Innovation
The project implements a **dual-approach architecture** that makes ast-grep accessible to both large and small language models:

1. **Direct Access**: Full CLI power for experienced users and large LLMs
2. **Guided Workflows**: Structured templates and examples for small LLMs

## Project Goals

### Primary Goal
Enable precise, structure-aware code editing for LLMs by leveraging ast-grep's AST-based pattern matching capabilities while maintaining accessibility for models of all sizes.

### Secondary Goals
- **Scope Navigation**: Provide surgical precision for scope-based refactoring
- **Multi-Language Support**: Support 20+ programming languages through Tree-sitter
- **Model Accessibility**: Optimize for both large (70B+) and small (8B) language models
- **Binary Management**: Automatic download and management of ast-grep binaries
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Snapshot testing, benchmarking, and evaluation frameworks

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **MCP Server**: Main server implementing the Model Context Protocol
2. **Binary Manager**: Automatic ast-grep binary download and management
3. **Pattern Library**: Extensive collection of ast-grep patterns and examples
4. **Evaluation Client**: Framework for testing LLM performance
5. **Snapshot Manager**: Testing infrastructure for consistent LLM responses

### Key Features
- **Minimal Tool Set**: Only 2 core tools for optimal small LLM performance
- **Rich Resources**: 50+ MCP resources for documentation and examples
- **Guided Prompts**: Template-based rule generation for small models
- **Multi-Platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Auto-Discovery**: Comprehensive resource navigation system

## Research-Driven Design

### Small LLM Optimization
Based on research with 8B parameter models:
- **Context Efficiency**: Tool descriptions under 100 words
- **Flat Parameters**: Simple, flat parameter structures
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Layer complexity only when needed
- **Template-Based**: "Mad libs" style prompts requiring minimal reasoning

### Success Metrics
- **Tool Calling Success**: >90% success rate for 8B parameter models
- **Pattern Construction**: Automated testing of generated patterns
- **Learning Progression**: Track graduation from prompts to direct tools

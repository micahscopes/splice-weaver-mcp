This folder contains comprehensive research and design documents for making MCP servers more usable for small LLMs.

## Structure

### `/research/` - Foundational Research
- **`mcp-best-practices-for-small-llms.md`** - Core research on MCP usability challenges and solutions
- **`mcp-resources-prompts-summary.md`** - Complete guide to MCP Resources and Prompts for small LLMs

### `/design/` - Design Documents
- **`mcp-non-tool-features-design.md`** - Technical design for Resources and Prompts in ast-grep server
- **`pattern-construction-strategy.md`** - Core strategy for building patterns from rough context
- **`example-based-learning-system.md`** - Detailed design for learning system using examples
- **`progressive-refinement-approach.md`** - Methodology for iterative pattern improvement

### `/implementation/` - Implementation Guide
- **`complete-pattern-construction-guide.md`** - Comprehensive implementation guide combining all approaches

## Key Findings

1. **Small LLMs struggle with complex tool schemas** - Need simplified, example-driven approaches
2. **MCP Resources and Prompts are game-changers** - Provide context and workflows that transform usability
3. **Pattern construction from rough context is possible** - Through example-based learning and progressive refinement
4. **90%+ success rates achievable** - With proper implementation of these strategies

## Next Steps

See the implementation guide for concrete steps to enhance your ast-grep MCP server with these capabilities.
